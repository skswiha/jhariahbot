"Please, you must excuse me, I cannot help but/Think I've overstayed my welcome"
"Please", she said, "It's hardly a bother/The company's quite nice on crimson nights like these"
Then he exits to the street below/Knowing he has no intention to return
Well, I think that I've gotta go, and I don't know why/But I need you to promise that you won't cry/'Cause you'll be fine, and so will I/So just let the thought of me die
And please let mе know, let those old memoriеs go
Feed me to the crows
Please understand that I will find a brand new life/My golden second try
Suddenly, in the mirrors of the windows that night/He found the man before him had died
Well, I think that I've gotta go, and I don't know why/But I need you to promise that you won't cry
'Cause you'll be fine, and so will I/So just let me out of your mind
In the morning you'll learn I disappeared off into the night so quietly/That your love for me will vanish too
My head is overflowing, with these thoughts/That if I return the favor you might understand
But I know, I know you could never carry the burden you’ve left with me and I can’t give it back/So why even try?
I’m reeling from all of the pain/I feel it making me insane
If it’s an eye for an eye then we all go blind/If it came to it would you cross that line?
With the taste of the blood on your tongue like wine/And the weight of your crimes weighing on your mind/It’s an eye for an eye and we all go blind again
An arm and a leg, my friend, les yeux d'la tete
I never give as much as I get
This path of heart attacks is paved with folks who only gave their enemies what they had coming/I don’t know if it’s worth it
I’m reeling from all of the pain
I’m reeling from all of the pain/I feel it making me insane
I feel it making me insane!
If it’s an eye for an eye then we all go blind/If it came to it would you walk that line?
With the taste of the blood on your tongue like wine/And the weight of your crimes weighing on your mind/Is it a knife or a lie is it in your back
Is it all I need? Is it all I have?
Will it bring me the peace that I need so desperately?
Will I see?
It’s an eye for an eye and we all go blind again
When you seek vengeance you must dig two graves
Eye for an eye, we all blind
Eye for an eye, we all blind
Eye for an eye, we all blind
Eye for an eye, we all blind
Eye for an eye, we all blind
If it’s an eye for an eye then we all go blind/If it came to it would you walk that line?
With the taste of the blood on your tongue like wine/And the weight of your crimes weighing on your mind/Is it a knife or a lie is it in your back?/Is it all I need? Is it all I have?
Will it bring me the peace that I need so desperately?/Will I see?
It’s an eye for an eye and we all go blind again
This time around’s no different/I’ve played with chance like you
I loved to toy with fate/But, oh, I didn’t have a clue/That I would lose, oh, I would lose
Between my left and right, one day I’d have to choose (I’d have to choose)
“You’re not like me, I’m not like you, I’m not who these things happen to“/And that’s exactly what you say before they do
I can’t dance like I used to/I don’t have the same moves as you
But that’s okay, fortune find your way/To someone who needs it much more than me
Hand in hand come human error/And plain bad luck
It seems the timing’s always wrong for the ones who wait too long
You’ll never catch a break, you’ll have to make your own
My legs drag behind me/And they creak in syncopated time/But I know that one day I will lose them too
I didn’t have a clue/That I would lose, oh, I would lose/Between my left and right, one day, I'd have to choose
“You’re not like me, I’m not like you, I’m not who these things happen to“/And that’s exactly what you say before it catches up to you
Before you play with knives and find yourself in two, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
I finally climbed to heights I/No matter how I try can’t descend
Still somehow they’re looking down on me/Laughing cause I got what I deserved
You got what you deserved/And I would do it again
I’m not sorry, but thank you for enduring me/As long as you did/That’s more than I’d ever ask of you
It's all catching up to you now, hope you can run/Cause soon your past will come and drag you/Down, down
You scammed your way into heaven/'Til the angels realize you're not one of them
Here comes the debt collector/Seems you owe him again/Dollars and coins can't cut your check/This time around
Here comes the debt collector/And you owe him again/Kind words and lies won't save your head/This time around, 'round, 'round
Gravedigger, cordial killer/Your payment is due, they're looking at you
We've done what we can, it's out of our hands/Sooner or later, it comes back again
Here comes the debt collector/Seems you owe him again/Dollars and coins can't cut your check/This time around
Here comes the debt collector/And you owe him again/Kind words and lies won't save your head/This time around
Please don't think I have no empathy for you/What you've been through, but/There's nothing I can do now but stand here and watch/It all catch up to you
Here comes the debt collector/Seems you owe him again/Dollars and coins can't cut your check/This time around
Here comes the debt collector/And you owe him again/Kind words and lies won't save your head/This time around
La da da da da, la da da dada/La la
I’m so glad I woke up today
A different life in a brand new place/I think I maybe outgrew the last
I needed a change of pace/No more talk of what my burdens say/They’ve been left behind, and that’s where they will stay
Fled the scene, nimble, my hands kept clean
I needed a change of pace
Needed a change of pace
Oh, how could you love me so?/Oh, with all I’ve done and the things you know?
My dearest, you bettеr never forgive mе/'Cause if you forget what I’ve done, I’ll do it again
I died that night and killed god in the morning
Left without a warning or even informing the coroner
I was a foreigner/Never belonged in that place, played along in that place/Till I had enough of the games
I couldn’t find the time from the afterlife/To apologize or even say goodbye
Oh, how could you love me so?/Oh, with all I’ve done and the things you know?
My dearest, you better never forgive me/'Cause if you forget what I’ve done, I’ll do it again
Needed a change of pace
I’ve come to realize/I’d rather flee than fight
Gone without a trace
To fake your death is/The most honest life
All it takes is an agile step and the vigilance to/Spot that blink of an eye
Oh, how could you love me so?/Oh, with all I’ve done and the things you know?
But still, you plead with me, baby, I guarantee/You’re better off if you let me go/'Cause even eye to eye, I’m not afraid to lie
A curse and a kiss goodbye
My whole life all I wanted was a change of pace
A soldier told me “boy, you can't escape, They're gonna/Find you soon or later and then/You'll be just like me” he said
“You're exactly what they're looking for and they're gonna/Find you, theres nowhere to hide!”
Well I for one can tell you that/It's never hard to keep out of sight
It's just a trick up the sleeve. They/Have no idea what they’re looking for/And ain't gonna find it
I know how to hide/Right beneath your noses/Where you least expect and never will look
Silently, obnoxiously, taunting every step that you take/Not a single footprint following the steps that I took
This one'll go down in the books
So watch watch me disappear before your eyes/And catch me if you can
Catch me, catch me, misplace and mismatch me
Tie your shoes in knots but you'll never harass me
Find me, find me, I dare you to try
I’ll bet on my survival/But now you’re gonna die out there
And suddenly I feel I'm invincible, a needle in hay/Detachable from all the wicked things in that place
It's a miracle that I got out of bed everyday/Before I knew I'd live to/Savor this day
I'm taking off/To my own grave
I'm running away
So watch watch me disappear before your eyes/And catch me if you can
Catch me, catch me, misplace and mismatch me/Tie your shoes in knots but you’ll never harass me
Find me, find me, I dare you to try
I’ll bet on my survival/But now you’re gonna die out there
Catch me, catch me, misplace and mismatch me
Tie your shoes in knots but you’ll never harass me
Find me, find me, I dare you to try
I’ll bet on my survival/But now you’re gonna die out there
Where could I be? Walking among you or inside your own homes? Or perhaps there's a part of me in all of you. (Hahaha!)
So catch me if you can/Catch me if you dare/Venture through the foul and you'll see what's fair
Catch me if you can
Catch me if you dare
You'll find me through the fog and the filthy air
Catch me, catch me, misplace and mismatch me/Tie your shoes in knots but you’ll never harass me
Find me, find me, I dare you to try
I’ll bet on my survival/But now you’re gonna die out there
Catch me, catch me, misplace and mismatch me
Tie your shoes in knots but you’ll never harass me here
Find me, find me, I dare you to try
I’ll bet on my survival/But now you’re gonna die out there
The world has turned itself on it’s head/The trees don’t grow they kill instead
Where hope once was the light’s turned black
We find find faith in the strangest places
The marchers walk the streets in reverse with their heads down/Blind to the color they’ve painted this town/They stare at mirrors, wearing masks/And prudently perform their task
They march along in single file/Surrendering their sense of style/Happily police the streets/With vacant eyes and plastic smiles
How can you watch our castles crumble down?
Stand in the ashes of your city that burned to the ground
I’m wonderin' where I heard this/“You said you'd give me purpose”
The marchers walk the streets in reverse with their heads down/Blind to the color they’ve painted this town
They stare at mirrors, wearing masks/And prudently perform their task
They march along in single file/Surrendering their sense of style/Happily police the streets/With vacant eyes and plastic smiles
March along in single file/Surrendering their sense of style/Happily police the streets/With vacant eyes and plastic smiles
The uniform will set you free/Close your eyes and you will see
They’ll soon do to you what they’ve done to me
They march along in single file/Surrendering their sense of style/(To me)
Happily police the streets/With vacant eyes and plastic smiles/(To me)
March along in single file/Surrendering their sense of style/(Me)
Happily police the streets/With vacant eyes and plastic smiles
Kerosene lit lanterns burn through faded pages/Not a single star graces our sky tonight
The crickets have grown bored of filling our silent spaces
We’re losing time and got to make this right
I sing this song to incinerate your skin/Just sing along and... (dance)
Build for us from their ashes/A brand new city
Set fire to your matches/Dowse them in gasoline
Rebuilding skyscrapers from broken glass and broken souls/Ain't got no blueprint just a purpose and a wrecking ball
Brick by brick, we’ll take back what they took/Stand in the ashes of what once belonged to you/And I’m so sick of this
Just take a good hard look/At how they blurred your vision/And they shaped your view
Let the sun just incinerate your skin/To start all over
Rebuild what they destroyed (Destroyed!)/Make weapons of your voice (Your voice!)
Whatever they employ, I’ll exploit, make null and void
Rebuilding skyscrapers from broken glass and broken souls/Ain't got no blueprint just a purpose and a wrecking ball
Brick by brick, we’ll take back what they took
Stand in the ashes of what once belonged to you/And I’m so sick of this
Just take a good hard look/At how they blurred your vision/And they shaped your view
Oh, brick by brick, we’ll take back what they took/Stand in the ashes of what once belonged to you
And I’m so sick of this/Just take a good hard look/At how they blurred your vision/And they shaped your view
I set all of these fires/But now I’m the one who’s all burnt out
Why is it so hard to fight for what's right
I’m breaking down
And what if I stepped out of this ring/I abandoned everything/I can’t carry this team
Marching along in single file/(This team, this team!)/Surrendering their lives/(This team)
Pitch black clouds shadow the burning sun/But I won’t let these vultures think that they have won
I’ll be the last one standing when the end’s begun/I’ll hide away so I don’t have to run
Brick by brick, we’ll take back what they took/Stand in the ashes of what once belonged to you
And I’m so sick of this/Just take a good hard look/At how they blurred your vision/And they shaped your view
Oh, brick by brick, we’ll take back what they took/Stand in the ashes of what once belonged to you/And I’m so sick of this
Just take a good hard look/At how they blurred your vision/And they shaped your view
I’m only here to kill my own confusion
I found a backdoor but no solution
Lying here while the sands fall down/Won't heal my hands right now or their blue contusions
I’m on a hell-bound elevator/When I got on I never planned for it to be this way
I burnt out the white hot flame inside me/Now my skin is scorched to ashes/And I’m burning in the flame
I wish I could reverse, reverse/And stop the hour glass/Because the earth is spinning round' the sun too fast
A dead end awaits this pointless track/I’m thinking I might get off and just turn back
I’m starting to see that the world is gonna end without me/I don’t wanna let it pass me by
I don’t wanna die here in this hole
I won’t fade away/I’ll detonate my soul
I wish I could reverse, reverse/And stop the hour glass/Because the earth is spinning round' the sun too fast/A dead end awaits this pointless track
I’m thinking I might get off and just turn back
I wish I could Reverse, Reverse/And stop the hour glass/Because the earth is spinning round' the sun too fast
A dead end awaits this pointless track/I’m thinking I might get off and just turn back
Then a fire started in the hallway/And the smoke rose to the sky/I looked inside myself and asked my ego why
If ashes turn to cities and the stars into the moon/Then why am I inside of my own mind?
I wish I could reverse, reverse/And stop the hour glass/Because the earth is spinning round' the sun too fast
A dead end awaits this pointless track/I’m thinking I might get off and just turn back
Reverse, reverse/And stop the hour glass/Because the earth is spinning round' the sun too fast/A dead end awaits this pointless track/I’m thinking I might get off and just turn back
I wish I could reverse, reverse
My time is running out/Because these words, they burn/And scorch inside my mouth
I’m mashing the buttons on the wall/I’m realizing that this car only goes down
I may be wrong but I don’t wanna be right/And I wanna save the world but I’m thinking I might/Destroy it from the inside out, inside out
If I’m gonna die it’ll be my way
It may be the end of it as we know/And I just hope that it won’t be my fault/(just hope that it won’t be your fault)
I’m the only one on this side of the war/Alone, alone, and rotten to the core
So maybe it’s not so bad if I just fall in line/If I just give in would it be a crime?
If I tried it, I might like it/But every ounce of me resists and I can’t describe it
I won’t believe a word you say/I know you might be right
You might be saving humankind/But my inseparable pride/Might be the death of you and me, me, me, yeah
It’s not so bad, It’s not so bad
It’s not so bad, It’s not so bad/It’s just the end of the world
So maybe it’s not so bad if I just fall in line/If I just give in would it be a crime?
If I tried it, I might like it/But every ounce of me resists and I can’t describe it
Maybe it’s not so bad if I just fall in line/If I just give in would it be a crime?
If I tried it, I might like it/But every ounce of me resists and I can’t describe it
Me, me, me, yeah
It’s not so bad, It’s not so bad/(So maybe it's not so bad)
It’s not so bad, It’s not so bad/(So maybe it's not so bad)
It’s just the end of the world/(So maybe it's not so bad)
It’s not so bad, It’s not so bad/(So maybe it's not so bad)
It’s not so bad, It’s not so bad/(So maybe it's not so bad)
You’re past the halfway point of a/Story that hopefully has a happy ending
You’re safe for now but are you happy?
Could you survive forever without living?
In any case, stay safe, stay strong/And never let them think they’ve won/Because once something’s been thought/It enters this wasteland that we call the real world/Then it becomes as real as you and me/And once that happens, it can happen
Slow down/Those words mean nothing/My brain just revs up faster/Pressure bomb in a goddamn knife fight
Ecstatic pathways runaway, flood my mind/Overstimulation makes me feel like I’m alive
Oh I wish there was a way that I could sing these lines/A million miles a minute maybe then I could begin to feel like/They could keep up with the semi-automatic/Static that’s keeping me up
It drives me forward every moment/Makes sure I don’t stop too long to/Smell the flowers/I been here too long I might burn up and explode
Slow down/Those words mean nothing
My brain just revs up faster/Pressure bomb in a goddamn knife fight
I get in the way of myself/And it hurts to admit/That sometimes I’m unequipped/To handle/It all on my own
But why do it alone?/You might burn out and explode
Slow down/Those words mean nothing/My brain just revs up faster/Pressure bomb in a goddamn knife fight
I’m at the end of my means/From idolizing a made-up man who one day could be me/But does that version sleep at night?/Or ever take a minute to just breathe?/Or Just to be?
Slow down/Those words mean nothing
My brain just revs up faster/Pressure bomb in a goddamn knife fight
Slow down/Those words mean nothing/My brain just revs up faster/Pressure bomb in a goddamn knife fight
Nowhere to run/Nowhere to hide/Your time is up/End of the line
What will you do about your promises/You bit off more than you can chew
I screamed at the top of my swollen lungs/“You’ll never get away with this”
I’ll be your villain if that’s what it takes/To continue burning how I’ve been
I promise this isn’t the end/As they dragged me away by my neck/Desperately gasping for air
I swore to all of you that I’d get my revenge/And you’ll want yours/When your kingdom falls in blazing glory/Then we’ll see who’s won/When your pawns betray your every single will
So when you go, won't you close the door?/Behind the world you used to own/Cause it won’t be yours anymore
I won’t break all the promises/I made to resist everything you do And everything you say
When you tried to take the spark in our eyes/Did you think it could go this wrong
I’d suggest that you raise your white flag high/Cause you lost when your puppets reclaimed their lives
I promised this to all my friends/To protect our identities
Desperately fighting for a chance I swore to/All of you that I'd get my revenge/And you’ll want yours/When your kingdom falls in blazing glory/Then we’ll see who’s won/When your pawns betray your every single will
So when you go, won't you close the door?/Behind the world you used to own/Cause it won’t be yours anymore
I won’t break all the promises/I made to resist everything you do And everything you say
So when you go, won't you close the door?/Behind the world you used to own/Cause it won’t be yours anymore
I won’t break all the promises/I made to resist everything you do And everything you say
So give a round of applause/To your "brainless audience"/To all of your "loyal pawns"/To their mindless radiance
So when you go, won't you close the door?/Behind the world you used to own/Cause it won’t be yours anymore
I won’t break all the promises/I made to resist everything you do And everything you say
So when you go, won't you close the door?/Behind the world you used to own/Cause it won’t be yours anymore
I won’t break all the promises/I made to resist everything you do And everything you say
I’ve been seeing sunsets for so long/Wonder how the sun feels when it falls/I’ve been searching so hard to find out/Why it rises every morning
I wish for unending resolve/To always get up when I fall, when I fall/And if they kick me when I’m down/Hope I separate my body from the ground and get up
Ba-da-ba-da-ba-ba-da-ba-da-ba
And follow with my heart/The momentum of that giant gleaming star
So what can I do/How can I be/So bright and true/The sun wonders of me
So take me to the light behind the moon/And all the stars that lit that dark and desolate room/And without fail I will prevail/I will light up this gloomy world/Soon as I’m done lighting up myself
I’ve got a feeling that this chapter/Will soon come to an end, to an end/And then we all can go to sleep/The burden of our bodies on our feet will let up
Ba-da-ba-da-ba-ba-da-ba-da-ba/Ba-da-ba-ba-da-ba
When the burning sun/Begins to fall
So what can I do/How can I be/So bright and true/The sun wonders of me
So take me to the light behind the moon/And all the stars that lit that dark and desolate room
And without fail I will prevail/I will light up this gloomy world/Soon as I’m done lighting up my/Soon as I’m done lighting up my/Soon as I’m done lighting up myself
I never thought I/Would muster the courage to leave here
I broke free of what kept me trapped here/And I don’t think I’m coming back here
So goodbye, farewell/I don’t need you now/I don’t need you now
These decaying walls were all that kept me sane/I entrusted everything I had and all my pain/In this Sheetrock jail, this self made prison/I’ve survived fine but I’m not living
This cautionary coffin, that I’m not dying off in
I’m breaking out to face my enemies/This time I’ll stop them
Almost forget them hiding in the dark/But they remember me and have my name upon their scars
Me and my past must rift apart/But I’ll always keep this on my arm
Goodbye to my new home/I miss you dearly even though/You might have stolen my whole life/But I don’t think that I’d be alone
I get this feeling that/I’m not the first and not the last/To find solace in this empty room/Broken but always true
How cliche for me to carve my name/Into the insides of this old rotten place
I’ll go away until another day
I hate that I can miss a room this way
It’s sad to say/Me and my past must rift apart/But I’ll always keep this on my arm
Goodbye to my new home
I miss you dearly even though/You might have stolen my whole life/But I don’t think that I’d be alone
I get this feeling that/I’m not the first and not the last/To find solace in this empty room/Broken but always true
Finally leave this shallow lens to/Just move on and make amends/With my past self, my naive goals
Take my wishes to the end
Goodbye to my new home/I miss you dearly even though/You might have stolen my whole life
But I don’t think that I’d be alone
I get this feeling that/I’m not the first and not the last/To find solace in this empty room/Broken but always true
Me and my past must rift apart/But I’ll always keep this on my arm
Humor me for another minute or two/Please let me tell you how it ends
Hear the great tale of how I ruined it all/If you have the will to spend
A curtain closes on our story/An empire fallen from glory
A selfish sense of justice/Implored me to save myself
Strange how it takes being down to have/Something to stand for
Then it all went down
I bid farewell
I took the crown from where it fell
I pulled the roots from where they/Rested In the rotten depths of hell
Can you hear the sound?/Of a brand new kingdom now/Of our old lights fizzled out
Light a new fire for what we used to aspire to be
You can’t tell me how to live/Or for what I’d give my life
Now the whole world’s singing this/Anthem into the dark of night
And in the dark we all gather one last time/To make something of the sticks and stones/That once built up their thrones/From sawdust build a brand new home, oh
And it all went down/I bid farewell
I took the crown from where it fell
A bright new flame/A blinding light/Astounding brilliance/Brand new life
Can you hear the sound?/Of a brand new kingdom now/Of our old lights fizzled out
Light a new fire for what we used to aspire to be
You can’t tell me how to live/Or for what I’d give my life
Now the whole world’s singing this/Anthem into the dark of night
In the lens through which some eyes will see/This tale is one of failure/And though I don’t think I’m your enemy/I’ll never be your savior
And in the lens through which some eyes will see/This tale is one of victory/And though I don’t think I’m a failure/I don’t deserve your sympathy
Can you hear the sound?/Of a brand new kingdom now/Of our old lights fizzled out
Light a new fire for what we used to aspire to be
You can’t tell me how to live/Or for what I’d give my life
Now the whole world’s singing this/Anthem into the dark of night
So we draw a new curtain/A new door becomes open/The tale of the sun has Come to an end/(But the tale of the sun can’t end)
Is it really a complex or just lacking context?
Why would someone go so far to be a walking lie?/Yeah, that don’t sound like me, I don’t think I’m that guy
(Enter "Beginner's Guide")
Please excuse our current appearance/I realize that it’s quite a mess/And our deepest apologies for all of the noise/We’re understaffed, and we're over-stressed
That I would lose, oh, I would lose/(Needed a change of pace)/Between my left and right, one day I'd have to choose/(Gone without a trace)
He found the man before him had died/(Yup!)
Three in the morning/A tortured boy sings/A chilling song no one sings along
The streets are vacant of the throng
The right side of his head throbs where he/Met the losing end of a brawl
Cause prior that night was talking real tough/Thought he was big stuff/He tested his luck
He’s got this nagging/This itch of which he’s had quite enough/He looks for a victim to satisfy his taste for blood
Breathe in, breath out, a car’s approaching now/Ya gotta give em a show, make your big debut
Start to walk with a limp he rolls his window down/Hey kid where ya going?
I’ve finally got you right where I want you/You don’t evеn know the half of what I’m gonna do
The rush crashes ovеr me like a wave in the sea/It floods all of my senses and tastes oh so sweet
Now who’s that boy there/He should be wary/Of seedy characters in the night/Who find their prey in their headlights
He’s got it planned carefully/First find a passerby in the night/Step two advance carefully/Make sure you’re friendly/Deadly/Step three is essential/Moment of truth/Ask em where to/Tell them so are you
Breathe in, breathe out, your car’s approaching now/Gotta give em a show make your big debut/Flash your finest grin roll your window down!
What if I said I would take your life tonight?/And If I said the same would it be a surprise?
What if I said I won’t go without a fight?/That I’m not the one who’s gonna die?
I’ve finally got you right where I want you/You don’t even know the half of what I’m gonna do
The rush crashes over me like a wave in the sea/It floods all of my senses and tastes oh so sweet
I don’t take the sea for granted, it could dry any time it wants
I don’t take the sky for granted, it could fall anytime it pleases
I don’t take the land for granted, it could flood anytime this year/Nor do I the seeds it’s planted, they could easily take me down
Why can't I get through, why can't I get through/Why can't I get through to you?
You’ll never understand 'til it’s gone and there’s blood on your hands
Well, I know damn well what I give is what I oughta get/But what if what I give is something I alone possess?
The world could turn itself on its head/It could turn clockwisе instead/The earth could spin to wеst
I don’t take the sea for granted, it could dry any time it wants/I don’t take the sky for granted, it could fall anytime it pleases
I don’t take the land for granted, it could flood anytime this year/Nor do I the seeds it’s planted, they could easily take me down
Take me down, take me down, take me/Take me down, take me down/Just don’t you take me for granted
The air in my lungs, it never comes easily/Sometimes my throat constricts, and I cannot breathe/I wheeze and pray for a gasp of fresh air
A slip of the tongue could rattle a house of cards/Like a snake, suffocate, asphyxiate
There’s no fix, too late
Tipping over, but you seem sober/So where’d that judgment go?
The world could turn itself on its head/It could turn clockwise instead
The earth could spin to west
I don’t take the sea for granted, it could dry any time it wants
I don’t take the sky for granted, it could fall anytime it pleases
I don’t take the land for granted, it could flood anytime this year/Nor do I the seeds it’s planted, they could easily take me down
Take me down, take me down, take me down/Take me down
Take a photo while you can/We won’t be here for long
Lonely wolf keeps friends as lambs/Starves when they are gone
I don’t take the sea for granted, it could dry any time it wants/I don’t take the sky for granted, it could fall anytime it pleases
I don’t take the land for granted, it could flood anytime this year/Nor do I the seeds it’s planted, they could easily take me down
How could I ever sleep at night?/My conscience left me petrified
Staring at the ceiling wide awake/Reliving all my worst mistakes
Til I finally got a decent job/And I got a place I'll never own/We'll knock some holes into the walls/To make it feel more like a home
How could I ever sleep at night?/When you left, you left me paralyzed
Tryna keep my head above the waves/Holding out for brighter better days
And you boys just lift me up to lеt me down/Every single timе you come around
I'm making friends who don't know who I am/Tryna turn the hurt into a brand
How could I ever sleep at night?/I'm blue dreaming about the better times
Anything to bring me close to you/Anything to take me back to
Friday nights/Foggy streets and Christmas lights
Wake me up on Saturday/Grab my hand and float away/Into the abyss again/And I will always be your friend
So grab my hand/Take my hand I can't do this alone
Friday nights/Foggy streets and Christmas lights/Wake me up on Saturday
Grab my hand and float away/Into the abyss again/And I will always be your friend/(Be your friend!)
So grab my hand/Take my hand I can't do this alone
Friday nights/Foggy streets and Christmas lights
Wake me up on Saturday/Grab my hand and float away/Into the abyss again
And I will always be your friend/(I'll be your friend!)
So grab my hand/Take my hand I can't do this alone
Na na na na nana na na/Na na na na nana na na/Na na na na nana na na
We'll make this feel more like a home
Agh! Oh my g—/Yoo!/Doing too much!
Savagery Intensity/I wish my brain would come and kill me
Stop
What’s a kid to do?
Lifting up her effervescence
Pleasant presence/Panicked pulse/Antidepressants/Acutely polarizing
I think it just might kill me split/Split
The things that she’s been through/Perpetuate her all or nothing
Hating loving/Always something/Hard at trusting
So leave the blade behind/Recite the chorus line
Lying from beneath/Stimulate my every need/Whethеr powdered or pilled
Whеther powdered or pilled/The thoughts they all insist
The prescription is unfilled/Whether powdered or pilled
Whether powdered or pilled/When my head begins to fall apart/I kill my brain and trust my heart
Love’s a temperamental art/Don’t know where the hate starts
Love you! Hate you!/Love you! Hate you!/Love you! Hate you!
Love you! Hate you!/Love you! Hate you!
Love you! Hate you!
Love you! Hate you!
Love you! Hate you!
I haven’t had a thing to smile about/Since I was locked up and lucked/Out of having any hope of/Becoming not so hopeless
You’re all I’ve got in this eternal hell/You’re all that makes me well
You’re all that makes me well
You’re all that makes me, all that makes me/Hate the way I do when I’m with you/The only one who makes me/Feel such lament and despise
You ain't no friend of mine
A subtle change in time
Betrayal tastes like wine/So leave the blade behind/Recite the chorus line
Lying from beneath/Stimulate my every need/Whether powdered or pilled
Whether powdered or pilled/The thoughts they all insist/The prescription is unfilled/Whether powdered or pilled
Whether powdered or pilled
When my head begins to fall apart/I kill my brain and trust my heart
Love’s a temperamental art/Don’t know where the hate starts
It’s just too much/(It’s never enough)
It’s just too much/(It’s never enough)
It’s just too much/(It’s never enough)
It’s just too much/(It’s never enough)
It’s just too much/(It’s never enough)
It’s just too much/(It’s never enough)
It’s just too much/(It’s never enough)
It’s just too—/(It’s never enough)
My sight’s divided once again/Who’s a foe, who’s a friend
Cut me open, fix the lens/That makes me think I must defend/And if that is not enough/To make me who I want to be/Leave me here and let me be
Lying from beneath/Stimulate my every need/Whether powdered or pilled
Whether powdered or pilled
The thoughts they all insist/The prescription is unfilled/Whether powdered or pilled
Whether powdered or pilled/When my head begins to fall apart/I kill my brain and trust my heart
Love’s a temperamental art/Don’t know where the hate starts
Love you! Hate you!/Love you! Hate you!
Love you! Hate you!/Love you! Hate you!/Love you! Hate you!
Love you! Hate you!/Love you! Hate you!
Love you! Hate you!
I can’t seem to escape from the place I stand
Without fail, I end up right back/In the comfort of tracks I’ve
Permanently scarred/On the same proverbial yard/That surrounds me so/It’s all I know
I promise next time the words will come out
If I take a step and give two back/Will you take or bow or dance?
(I swear)/It’s the last time
(Just give)/Me one more try
If you have to hear this song again/Can I pray it’d have a chance
(I swear)/It’s the last time/(Just give)/Me one more try
Try, fall
Try, fall/Try, fall
Try again
Try, fall
Try, fall/Try again
If I take a step and give two back/Will you take or bow or dance?
(I swear)/It’s the last time/(Just give)/Me one more try
If you have to hear this song again/Can I pray it’d have a chance
(I swear)/It’s the last time
(Just give)/Me one more try
