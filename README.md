This uses a list of lyrics (someday I will integrate it with Genius 
or something but today is Not That Day) and tweets a random one every 
hour! The lyric list here is not fully updated, since I use a different, private git with config info in it to actually tweet, but the list that the bot uses is up to date, I promise! This git is just so that people can conveniently look at the code.
